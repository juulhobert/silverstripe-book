#### Errata
Although we have taken every care to ensure the accuracy of our content, mistakes do happen. If you find a mistake in the book (maybe a mistake in the text or the code) we would be grateful if you would report this to us. By doing so, you can save other readers from frustration and help us improve subsequent versions of this book. If you find any errata, please report them by creating a ticket at https://github.com/xeraa/silverstripe-book/issues.
Any existing errata can be viewed at https://github.com/xeraa/silverstripe-book/wiki.

#### Addon Chapters
To keep the book mean and lean (while also sticking to the original price tag), two chapters are only available as downloads:

* *Chapter 10 "Creating an Application"*: Please note that this has been changed to chapter 11 by the publisher to avoid any holes in the printed book. However, it's intended to be chapter 10. The downloadable code follows the original order, so the code in the folder ``chapter-11/`` is for the printed chapter 10. ``chapter-10/`` is the code for the download chapter.
* *Appendix A "Installing SilverStripe"*

#### Modules
The following modules based on the ones created in the book are available:

* Facebook feed widget: https://github.com/xeraa/silverstripe-widget_facebookfeed
* Gallery and intro page: https://github.com/xeraa/silverstripe-module_gallery

## The Book
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, databases, frameworks, CMS, and many other fast-evolving technologies make up modern web-development. How can you effectively create stunning results without being limited by the ease of your tools? That's where SilverStripe CMS comes into play.

SilverStripe, with its simple and intuitive design, is easy to work with and offers numerous customization opportunities. But understanding the options available and getting hands-on with the development techniques is not a piece of cake and certainly not a delightful experience if you're relying on tutorials and documentation available online.

*Silverstripe 2.4 Module Extension, Themes, and Widgets: Beginner's Guide* takes you through designing catchy and flexible templates, adding powerful features effortlessly, integrating everything into an intuitive backend for easy administration in a simple way, and implementing nifty features with minimal effort. From the most basic to complex forms, from simple to sophisticated pages, you'll learn how to get the most out of your SilverStripe application. SilverStripe keeps everything nice and simple, but if you need to, you can extend and customize every part of it. Graphic examples illustrate the general principle of operation, gradually introducing the finer details needed to get professional results. Common requirements such as image galleries, site search, and more can be reused or extended to fulfill your needs.

The author's experience in designing and developing SilverStripe projects enables him to share insights on creating professional web applications in a clear and friendly way.

You will start off with creating your own templates - covering the general layout, while also taking search engine optimization into consideration. Next, you will look at the logic driving your web application, and the database. Using these basic concepts, you will start building more advanced features. These include the integration of Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook, image galleries, the handling of user-supplied information, your own full-text search, and more. Finally, you'll even translate and internationalize your project. All of this can be easily achieved with SilverStripe.

All of this and quite a bit more is covered by *Silverstripe 2.4 Module Extension, Themes and Widgets: Beginner's Guide*. Besides general principles, the focus is on reusable code - getting your project started in no time.

A practical guide for extending SilverStripe applications with ease, describing real-life examples right from the start
